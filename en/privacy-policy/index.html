We provide no guarantees regarding the information provided prior to opting out. Some providers may have additional opt-out mechanisms implemented.</p><p class="flow-text">If you turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” on your iOS device or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” on your Android device, you can restore interest-based ads by turning the settings off. When you opt out, you may still see the same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on your interests. Our advertising partners may continue to serve you ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the application you are using.</p><p class="flow-text">Your iOS or Android mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising” setting. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, our partners will not use information collected from that device to infer your interests, or to serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests. You can find the setting for your mobile device by following the directions below, or contact your device provider.</p><p class="flow-text">The reason for switching from device IDs to Advertising Identifier is that advertisers are able to use this identifier only for advertising and for no other purpose, while users can choose to opt out of tracking via the settings of mobile phone. Advertising Identifier is an anonymous identifier for advertising purposes which enables users to reset their identifier or opt out of interest-based ads. The parties participating in advertising are obligated to follow users’ choice for opting out of tracking according to the app store guidelines.</p><p class="flow-text">For Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up: Open your Google Settings app <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Ads <!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> Enable “Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising”</p></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/en/privacy-policy/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-300fa9a4ae17d88dc319.js"],"app":["/app-add194bfa6354a7f7b47.js"],"component---cache-caches-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js":["/component---cache-caches-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js-5a1ee105f05b3144b807.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-5c9b13512b899a5451f7.js"],"component---src-pages-en-privacy-policy-js":["/component---src-pages-en-privacy-policy-js-8078a112d437472ea782.js"],"component---src-pages-es-privacy-policy-js":["/component---src-pages-es-privacy-policy-js-fe5df726e51981a9cfff.js"],"component---src-pages-index-en-js":["/component---src-pages-index-en-js-4419ad0afc0aa58ceac0.js"],"component---src-pages-index-es-js":["/component---src-pages-index-es-js-d4d31a6bb11b3e2a8adb.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-447e6cecc88de6af82d6.js"],"component---src-pages-it-privacy-policy-js":["/component---src-pages-it-privacy-policy-js-4199e4bd808882f5d041.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-300fa9a4ae17d88dc319.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-pages-en-privacy-policy-js-8078a112d437472ea782.js" async=""></script><script src="/6a2d92d622cba75de8e624887868e3cdc835a08e-c6549fcf60e1846f04b4.js" async=""></script><script src="/0f713082-a1b0188bcf1adf647d7d.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-2d82ac8e3afc0c213061.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-add194bfa6354a7f7b47.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-1a1efb3f5c798a012f4a.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-7b5587780b0e0ea41fd5.js" async=""></script></body></html>
